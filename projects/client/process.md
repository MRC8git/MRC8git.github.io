## Meeting #1 (1/14/2026)

### Initial Expectations and Discussion Points

    - Theme(gist)
        - Color

        - Shapes 
    - Webpages
        - How many?
        - Topics/information the client wants covered
        - General ideas/layouts of pages ---> does the client want a lot of text on one page(scrolling down), not a lot of text on any one page(moving between pages more/more complex navigation), etc
