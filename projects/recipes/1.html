	<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I chose this recipe because it is the main family recipe that I think of 
when I think of family recipes(and it's delicious). The original recipe had far
more vegetables--until I came along. My dad told me that,<q> at one point, [he] 
would make the sauce as it now, split it into two, and then add the 
veggies to the pot for [my parents]--and leave [mine] without.</q> Eventually, he got 
rid of the healthier ones alltogether. I do like vegetables--just not the ones
that were in the original version(eg. olives, mushrooms).</p>

<h2>Tips, Tricks, and Things to Remember</h2>

<ul>
	<li>With this recipe, especially doubled or for smaller families,
	leftover or extra sauce is common. Thankfully, if this is the case for
	you, and you end up with more sauce than your household can eat before
	it goes bad(pleas don't eat any sauce that's been in the fridge for
	over a week and a half), there is a simple solution---freeze it! We do 
	this almost every time we make this sauce, and we've found that it 
	freezes and reheats very well. To freeze, pour remaining sauce into a 
	cupcake mold, and place in the freezer. Now, you could leave it in the 
	mold until you need it next, but it also works to take out the pucks 
	and place into a resealable bag. Hope this helps!</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>If you do want to add the healthier food items that young me vetoed
, or anything along those lines, don't be afraid to add them in and experiment!
Just because little me hated olives and mushrooms(and got them removed from the
recipe), doesn't mean that you can't add them back in. Maybe you would love it!
Or not, but it doesn't hurt to try.</li>
