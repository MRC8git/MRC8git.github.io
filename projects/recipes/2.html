	<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I'm historically a picky eater, going through periods of liking or hating 
foods entirely. Eggs are one food that I've gone back and forth on a <strong>
lot</strong>. I've never liked the texture of tomatoes, but I have, usually, 
liked theflavor of them. It's certainly not an original recipe, but my mom's 
version has been, in her words, <q>the only consistent way to get [me] to eat 
eggs</q>--especially when I was little.</p>

<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Place pan on the stove and set to medium heat. Once hot, add the 
	sliced tomatoes.
	Cook until softened(some liquid, but not mushy--still some body to the 
	tomatoes)</li>
	<li>While the tomatoes are cooking: crack the eggs into a medium/large 
	bowl w/ salt and pepper, and beat them; cut up(lightly mince) the basil
	</li>
	<li>Once done, put tomatoes into a bowl and set to the side.</li> 
	<li>Then, in the pan you cooked the tomatoes in, add the beaten eggs. 
	Scrammble with spatula until they look <strong>almost</strong> done.
	</li>
	<li>From here, add the tomatoes back in along with the basil.</li>
	<li>Finish the eggs, turn off the heat, and plate to serve</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tips, Tricks, and Things to Remember</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Be extra careful about when you add the tomatoes back into the eggs
, as it will make or break the meal.--To early, the eggs come out watery. To 
late, the tomatoes will not combine with the eggs.</li>
	<li>Do your best to cut the tomatoes evenly, or else they wont cook 
evenly and the texture won't be consistent.</li>
	<li>Fresh basil is always the way to go!(if you can)</li>
</ul>
